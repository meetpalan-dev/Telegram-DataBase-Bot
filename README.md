# Telegram Database Bot System

A searchable file storage system built on top of Telegram.

This project turns a Telegram channel into a structured file database.  
Files are indexed, searchable by keywords, and automatically retrieved through coordinated worker bots monitored by a supervisor service and a web dashboard.

Instead of storing files on a traditional server, Telegram acts as the storage layer while Python services provide querying, indexing, and reliability control.

## Overview

The system continuously scans a Telegram channel and builds a searchable index using file names and captions.

Users can request files by typing keywords — not exact filenames — and the bot retrieves matching messages automatically. Results are paginated and delivered in batches similar to search results.

Multiple independent services work together:

- Index Bot → scans channel and builds searchable metadata
- Forwarder Bot → retrieves matching files
- Clean Bot → manages forwarded messages
- Supervisor → monitors bots and restarts on failure
- Dashboard → shows runtime health status
- Backup Service → preserves index data

This effectively transforms Telegram into a lightweight searchable storage backend.
