# Telegram Database Bot System

A searchable file storage system built on top of Telegram.

This project turns a Telegram channel into a structured file database.  
Files are indexed, searchable by keywords, and automatically retrieved through coordinated worker bots monitored by a supervisor service and a web dashboard.

Instead of storing files on a traditional server, Telegram acts as the storage layer while Python services provide querying, indexing, and reliability control.

## Overview

The system continuously scans a Telegram channel and builds a searchable index using file names and captions.

Users can request files by typing keywords — not exact filenames — and the bot retrieves matching messages automatically. Results are paginated and delivered in batches similar to search results.

Multiple independent services work together:

- Index Bot → scans channel and builds searchable metadata
- Forwarder Bot → retrieves matching files
- Clean Bot → manages forwarded messages
- Supervisor → monitors bots and restarts on failure
- Dashboard → shows runtime health status
- Backup Service → preserves index data

This effectively transforms Telegram into a lightweight searchable storage backend.

A lightweight web dashboard also exposes a health-check interface to verify whether the service is running.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

2. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Copy environment file
.env.example → .env

4. Run supervisor
python -m supervisor.main

## Project Status

The core system — indexing, keyword search, and file retrieval — is fully functional.

Additional operational components such as advanced monitoring and automation services are optional enhancements and still being refined.  
They improve observability and reliability but are not required for the main functionality of the system.

The project is actively evolving with a focus on improving stability and operational tooling.

## Note

This project is created for educational and experimental purposes to explore system design, service orchestration, and unconventional storage approaches using messaging platforms.
