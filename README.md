# Telegram Database Bot System

A multi-bot Telegram file storage system that uses a Telegram channel as a database, managed by a supervisor service and monitored through a web dashboard.

This project explores how a messaging platform can act as a backend storage layer while maintaining reliability through monitoring, restart logic, and backup services.

---

## Overview

The system consists of multiple independent worker bots coordinated by a supervisor:

- Index Bot → scans a Telegram channel and builds a searchable file index
- Forwarder Bot → sends requested files to users
- Clean Bot → manages and cleans forwarded messages
- Supervisor → monitors bots and restarts them on failure
- Dashboard → displays runtime status
- Backup Service → periodically stores index data

Telegram acts as the storage medium while Python services act as the control layer.
